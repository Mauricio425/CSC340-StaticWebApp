            So you want to work for us? Before we tell you anything about us and how to work here, we should tell you that
            there is nothing to know. This is a completely fictional poorly made store page that is "selling" books and comics 
            that are all property of <a href="https://poorlydrawnstore.com/"> Poorly Drawn Lines </a>. If you want to work with us... Don't.
            The best you can do is apply to the official Poorly drawn store website and "Hope for the best".
