            So you want to contact us? Before we tell you anything about how to reach us we should tell you that
            there is no reason to contact us. This is a completely fictional poorly made store page that is "selling" books and comics 
            that are all property of <a href="https://poorlydrawnstore.com/"> Poorly Drawn Lines </a>. This poorly made comic store
            is based in Greensboro, NC. If you have still have any other questions about our business we strongly recommend you "Think"
            again, and if you still want to have a "Discussion" after well...
