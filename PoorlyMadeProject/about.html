            So you want to know more about us? Before we tell you anything about us, we should tell you that
            there is nothing to know. This is a completely fictional poorly made store page that is "selling" books and comics 
            that are all property of <a href="https://poorlydrawnstore.com/"> Poorly Drawn Lines </a>. This poorly made comic store
            is based in Greensboro, NC. If you have any other questions about our business check out the poorly made map of the ocean
            which will lead you to any answers you may be seeking.
